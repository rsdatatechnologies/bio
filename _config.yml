  I don't stay in one place for too long. I'm constantly chasing new technologies, more powerful frameworks, 
  larger projects. I create value in the gaps between the industries I'm familiar with (currently Augmented Reality,
  3D Animation, Web Development, Mobile App Development, and Cloud Architecture). I only commit to projects I am truely 
  passionate about - there is no time for anything else.
